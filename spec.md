# Personal site hero – Finder style portfolio (v1)

Goal: recreate the attached screenshot exactly (layout + vibe).

Must-haves:
- warm beige background
- centered title “portfolio” + small subtitle line
- faint fibonacci spiral overlay (very light)
- 3 folder icons (tan left, blue top-right, red bottom-right)
- centered portrait cutout with rounded blob mask
- a Mac-style window below (“about me”) with 3 dots and content

Interaction (v1):
- clicking a folder opens that window content
- window can close
